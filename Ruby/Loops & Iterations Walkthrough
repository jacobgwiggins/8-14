Intro to Loops

“While”
Simple loop to iterate through each element in an array
Names =  [“John”, “George”, “Paul”, “Ringo”]
i = 0

While name[i] do 
 	Puts name[i]
i+=1
End

“Until” 
Like “unless”
Can make a countdown timer
Days_left = 7
Until days_left = 0
	puts “there are still #{days_left) days left until my birthday”
	Days_left -= 1
End

“For”
Better than a while loop, no counter
For name in names 
	Puts name
End 

Hash = { :name => “Louie”, :age => “27, :city => “Oakland }

For key, val in hash 
	Puts #{key} is #{val}
End

“.each”
Names.each do |name|
	Puts name
End

Reverse the names in a new array
“.map”
Names.map do |name|
	Puts name.reverse
end
